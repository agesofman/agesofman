## Introduction

The *Ages of Man* project applies advanced statistical methodology on remote sensing agriculture. It is composed of several R packages, as well as other elements, each one focusing on a different application.

  -   `cronus` is an R package that focuses on database creation. It can be used to download and process agricultural, environmental and satellite data from various sources.
  -   `persephone` is an R package that deals with applications in crop development.
  -   `hermes` is an R project that stores files. It includes executable R scripts, shiny applications, rmd reports, plots and more.
  -   `Demeter` is the database created by `cronus` and used by the *Ages of Man* project team members in their research studies.
  -   `Athena` is a Mendeley collection of research papers available to the *Ages of Man* project team members.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `agesofman` from github by running the following line of code: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
 devtools::install_github("agesofman/agesofman")
```

All packages of the *Ages of Man* project will be automatically installed. Although not necessary, it is strongly recommended to download `hermes`, which contains many executable examples, that can help users get familiar with the project. More details on `hermes` can be found in `vignette(topic = "hermes", package = "agesofman")`.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation, along with reproducible examples, can be found in the package vignettes.

```{r}
vignette(topic = "agesofman", package = "agesofman")
vignette(topic = "hermes", package = "agesofman")
```
